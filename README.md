# Software Architecture Styles

Software architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system, defining its components, relationships, and interactions. Various architecture styles or patterns have emerged over time, each with its own principles and characteristics. Here's an overview of some common types of software architectures:

## 1. Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where all components of an application are tightly integrated into a single codebase. This architecture is simple but can become complex to maintain as the application grows.

Example: Traditional WordPress, Magento 1

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

In a client-server architecture, the application is split into client and server components. The client handles user interface, while the server manages data processing and business logic. Communication occurs over a network.

Example: Web applications interacting with remote databases

## 3. Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture decomposes an application into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for specific business capabilities. Communication happens through APIs, promoting scalability and maintainability.

Example: Netflix, Uber

## 4. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

SOA focuses on designing services as independent, reusable components that provide specific functionalities. Services communicate through standardized protocols and can be combined to create larger applications.

Example: Enterprise systems with reusable services

## 5. Layered Architecture

Layered architecture divides an application into distinct layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data storage. Communication generally flows in a sequential manner between layers.

Example: Three-tier architecture - presentation, application, database layers

## 6. Event-Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture emphasizes components that communicate by producing and consuming events. This architecture is useful for real-time and asynchronous systems.

Example: IoT applications, financial trading systems

## 7. Component-Based Architecture

Component-based architecture focuses on building software using reusable, self-contained components. Components can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

Example: JavaBeans, .NET components

## 8. Pipes and Filters Architecture

In this architecture, data processing occurs through a sequence of filters connected by pipes. Each filter transforms or filters data.

Example: Image processing applications

## 9. Repository Architecture

Repository architecture focuses on data storage and retrieval. It abstracts interactions between the application and data storage, providing a consistent interface for data access.

Example: MediaWiki, content management systems

## 10. Space-Based Architecture

Space-based architecture uses a shared, distributed "space" for component communication. Components store and retrieve data from the space.

Example: Grid computing, high-performance computing

## 11. Event-Sourcing Architecture

Event-sourcing architecture stores the state of an application as a sequence of events. Each action or change in state is recorded as an event.

Example: Financial systems, audit logging

## 12. Serverless Architecture

Serverless architecture abstracts server management from developers. Applications are built using functions that automatically scale as needed.

Example: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions

Each software architecture style has its own advantages and considerations. The choice depends on factors like project requirements, scalability needs, and development team expertise.

# 3. Microservices Architecture with Code Example

Microservices architecture is an approach where an application is divided into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. Each service represents a specific business capability and communicates with others through APIs. This architecture enhances scalability, fault isolation, and allows technology diversity within the application.

### Characteristics:

- Services are independently deployable and manageable.
- Each service has its own database or data store.
- Services communicate over well-defined APIs (HTTP/REST, gRPC, etc.).
- Technology stacks can vary between services.
- Scalability can be achieved by scaling individual services.

### Code Example:

Let's consider a simplified e-commerce application with two microservices: Product Service and Order Service.

#### Product Service (Python with Flask):

```python
# products.py

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Mocked product data
products = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Product A", "price": 50.0},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Product B", "price": 75.0}
]

@app.route('/products')
def get_products():
    return jsonify(products)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
